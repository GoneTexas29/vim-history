Announcing: Exuberant Ctags
Author    : Darren Hiebert

This is to announce the availability of my new, better ctags utility. I am
quite pleased with it, and others who have used it have been enthusiastic
about the greater reliability and functionality it provides.

You can find it at any of:

What makes this ctags desirable?

1.  It can find *all* types of C language tags, including all of the
    following:

            macro definitions
            enumerated values (values inside enum{...})
            function and method definitions
            enum/struct/union tags
            external function prototypes (optional)
            typedefs
            variable declarations

2.  It is far less easily fooled by code containing #if preprocessor
    conditional constructs, using a conditional path selection algorithm
    to resolve complicated choices, and a fall-back algorithm when this one
    fails.

3.  Can also be used to print out a list of selected objects found in source
    files.

4.  Supports UNIX, MSDOS, WindowsNT, Windows95, OS/2 and the Amiga. In some
    cases, you may need to play with the include files, depending upon you
    compiler. Some pre-compiled binaries may become available on the web site.

I wrote this because of my disappointment with the other ctags utilities that
are available. However, it does have a couple of minor limitations (you be the
judge):

1)  Support for C++ is limited.
2)  Supports only C; not Lisp, shell scripts, or anything else you might
    think of.
