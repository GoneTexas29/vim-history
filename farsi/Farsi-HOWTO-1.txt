Farsi support precondition
==========================

In order to use right-to-left and Farsi mapping support, it is necessary to
compile Vim with FKMAP section in the feature.h activated.

Farsi fonts
===========

        There is one Farsi extended ASCII font available, both for 
        X environment and the ascii screen mode (graphic card) :

		 far-a01  

        SUN font is under the fonts/sun subdirectory.
        LINUX font is under the fonts/linux subdirectory.
        DOS font is under the fonts/dos subdirectory.


Font Installation
=================

   Linux System
   ------------

	*  X window fonts

		Copy far-a01.pcf.Z font into a directory of your choice. 
		Change to the directory containing these fonts and call 
		the followings:

			mkfontdir 
			xset +fp path_name_of_fonts_directory

	*  ASCII screen fonts 

		Copy far-a01.f16 font into the /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts 
		directory, then use the setup-io.farsi script to set the 
		environment:


   SunOs System
   ------------

	*  X window fonts

		Copy far-a01.bf font into a directory of your choice. 
		Change to the directory containing these fonts and
		call the followings:

			fldfamily 
			xset +fp path_name_of_fonts_directory

   DOS system
   ----------

	Copy far-a01.com font uploaders into a directory of your choice.
        Upload the graphic card before starting a program using
        this font, by just calling far-a01.com.


Running the vim (Farsi)
=========================

   Linux system in ASCII screen mode
   ---------------------------------

	Before running the vim within an ascii screen, the graphic card,
        keyboard and console driver have to be configured. The setup-io.farsi
        script does this for you. Then start the vim as follows:

	vim options file ...

        Note: The setup-io.farsi must be executed once, either during the
              startup or anytime in a superuser shell ( root ).


   X environment within its own Motif/Athena window
   ------------------------------------------------

        Start the vim in a xterm with the additional -g option as follows:

              vim -g -fn far-a01 ... &

        Calling the vim as 'gvim' is the same as calling 'vim -g' , e.g.:

              gvim -fn far-a01 ... &



   X environment within a xterm 
   ----------------------------

        Start an ANSI compatible xterm with a Farsi extended ascii font,
        e.g. :

              xterm -fn far-a01 &

        Then call the vim from within this xterm.

        Note:
             You can find ANSI compatible xterm on the linux distributed
             CD's or in the Internet.


   DOS system
   ----------

	Before running the vim upload the graphic card, by calling 
        far-a01.com, then start the vim as follows:

	vim options file ...
